## Automatic Detection of Sewer Defects via Hierarchical Deep Learning / Deep Learning, CNN
Developed a model which includes a Convolution Neural Network based framework for Image Processing on collected image Dataset. Applied multiple functionalities such as Image Augmentation, Extract Region Proposals and other pooling methodologies on different CNN models such as ResNet50, VGG10 and Inception v3 for better inspection and detection of accuracy. Achieved an Accuracy of 99.8 with ResNet50 Model.
